## APIs

HIU has a distributed infrastucture so there is no one domain for APIs.  GeoNode, a core part of HIU's infrastructure, supports 3 APIs: (1) CSW, (2) OGC, and (3) internal GeoNode API.  Each HIU instance of GeoNode can be interfaced using all of those APIs.

If you are starting off, we'd suggest you take a look at State GeoNode's API ([http://geonode.state.gov/about/api/](http://geonode.state.gov/about/api/)).

## Science and Technology (S&T) Programs

### CyberGIS

The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects. The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, [GeoGig](http://geogig.org), OGR, and OpenLayers. The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE

The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement. This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE. See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information. HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastructure.

### MapGive

MapGive, an initiative of the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s Humanitarian Information Unit, makes it easy for new volunteers to learn to map and get involved in online tasks.

### Imagery to the Crowd

The Imagery to the Crowd Initiative (ITTC) is a core initiative of the Humanitarian Information Unit. Through ITTC, HIU publishes high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, licensed by the United States Government, in a web-based format that can be easily mapped by volunteers. These imagery services are used by volunteers to add baseline geographic data into OpenStreetMap, such as roads and buildings. The imagery processing pipeline is built from opensource applications, such as TileCache and GeoServer. All tools developed by HIU for ITTC are open source.

## Websites

### State GeoNode

Primary open geographic data platform of the U.S. Department of State. The State GeoNode is a digital service provided by the U.S. Department of State for publishing open geographic data produced by or compiled by the U.S. Government to the public, U.S. Government decision-makers, and partners on complex emergencies, natural disasters, and diplomatic activities world-wide.

### Ebola GeoNode

This is a partnership platform for sharing geospatial data, analysis and maps related to the Ebola emergency response. The platform is intended to minimize the time that GIS analysts spend locating up-to-date data. Users are able to make maps on the fly, view metadata, and access the reports behind GIS layers. Curators are working to ensure that the layers are recent, clean, useful, and legally and technically open.

### Cusco GeoNode

The Cusco GeoNode is a geospatial platform provided by the U.S. Department of State, Humanitarian Information Unit as part of the Secondary Cities project. The Cusco GeoNode is used for collaborating on and sharing geospatial data among the US Government and partners in Peru. Learn more on the about page.
